		<p>SDG 1 No Poverty, is  one of the most critical goals of the united Nations sustainable development goals(SDG).
		aims to end poverty in all its forms, everywhere. For the first time, as part of the SDGs, countries have committed to reducing child poverty.
		Children experience poverty differently from adults, their needs and expectations are different, and for children, the effects of poverty can be lifelong.
		Poverty is one of the most persistent issues facing the world today,impacting millions of people across the globe. This goal
		recognizes that poverty is not just about the inability to access basic services and opporyunities that provide dignity and well-being.

		<p>Students can volunteer their time and skills to help organizations working to combat poverty.Whether it's working in local food, tutoring children from low -income
		families, or participating in community cleanup  projects, volunteering has an immediate impact on the lives of those need. Students can use their creativity
		to raise awareness about poverty through social media campaignm community events, or even school project. By educating
		others aboutthe issues related to poverty and the importance SDG 1, students can inspire action and create a ripple effect in their communities.
